Models
======

We present a set of example models that have been used to evaluate the functionality of the converter. You can find these models in the repo `ReadMe <https://github.com/MyoHub/myo_converter/blob/main/README.md#example-models>`_.

In addition to these example models, we maintain here a list of models that have been converted and used by other users. This aims to minimize redundant efforts in converting the same models. However, it's important to note that we cannot guarantee the quality or accuracy of these listed models, since there is no universal quality/accuracy test. Therefore, we strongly recommend thoroughly checking/testing these models before using in your own projects.

If you encounter any issues with the listed models, we kindly request that you report them to the original creator or maintainer of the model. This ensures that any problems can be addressed by the appropriate individuals.

In general, rather than recreating identical models, we encourage users to focus their efforts on refining and improving existing models. Collaboration and refinement of existing resources can lead to greater efficiency and quality within the community.


- `myoSim <https://github.com/MyoHub/myo_sim>`_:
 myoSim is the musculoskeletal model library that extensively used in the `myoSuite <https://github.com/facebookresearch/myosuite>`_ (a deep learning framework for MSK movement task trainings). MyoSim currently contains several converted and (manually) well tuned *finger*, *hand*, *arm*, and *leg* models.
