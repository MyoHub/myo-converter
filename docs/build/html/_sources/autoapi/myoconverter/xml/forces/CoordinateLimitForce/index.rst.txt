   Bases: :py:obj:`myoconverter.xml.parsers.IParser`

   CoordinateLimitForce parser has not been implemented. These forces probably should be optimized after the
   conversion process. I'll leave the old conversion code (from O2MConverter) here for reference, but it is not entirely correct,
   and would require further development.

   Another option to implementing CoordinateLimitForces might be to use MuJoCo tendons, with suitably chosen
   springlengths. The issue with this approach is that there might be multiple tendons for each DoF; would also need
   optimization after conversion process.
