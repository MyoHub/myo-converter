Welcome to MyoConverters's documentation!
=========================================

**MyoConverter** is a software to convert and optimize biomechanical `OpenSim <https://simtk.org/projects/opensim/>`_ models to the `MuJoCo <http://www.mujoco.org/>`_ physics engine.

Have a look at our `catalogue of converted and optimized models <models.html>`_. Note that these models are intended to provide a starting point. You may need to further modify e.g. joint limits, or add contacts according to your use case.

This software is intended for OpenSim 4.x models. If you have an OpenSim 3.x model, or earlier, it is recommended to update the model to the 4.x format using OpenSim's software. If this is not possible, then we suggest you try out the `O2MConverter <https://github.com/aikkala/O2MConverter>`_ which converts OpenSim 3.x models, but does not include moment arm and force optimizations. 


.. note::

   This project is under active development. We welcome `community contribution <participate.html>`_ for further improvement and development of these models.
