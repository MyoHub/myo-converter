.. _plan:

We the main developers AI and HW maintain and contribute to this project in our spare time, and hence cannot develop extensive features (at least in a short time frame). However, currently on our to-do list are the following topics

1. **Improve conversion of conditional and moving path points**

   - *Plan*: These types of path points are meant to describe the movement of path points due to tendon wrapping, hence a tempting solution to replace them by actual wrapping objects. The size, position, and possibly orientation of these wrapping objects would need to be optimized. 
   - *Starting date*: undetermined
   - *Finishing date*: undetermined
2. **Contact geometry conversion**

   - *Plan*: 
   - *Starting date*: undetermined
   - *Finishing date*: undetermined
3. **Elastic muscle model**

   - *Plan*: Use the [new MuJoCo update](https://github.com/deepmind/mujoco/issues/305) to create an elastic tendon muscle model.
   - *Starting date*: undetermined
   - *Finishing date*: undetermined
