- The above credits, license, and citation info apply to the file HYOID_1.2_ScaledStrenght_UpdatedInertia_adjusted.osim. In this file we have adjusted the operation range of pitch1, roll1, yaw1, pitch2, roll2, yaw2, so that the mapping from them to the rotation axis is be 1:1 (current pipeline cannot handle other mapping ratio). The corresponding joint constraints that are based on these joints are also adjusted to maintain the same coupling relationship. This adjustment will create different joint operation range than the original osim model, but the behavior should be the same. In the long run, we will find ways to solve this automatically inside the pipeline.
