Notes: 2D, 6 DOF leg model adpated by Jeff Reinbolt and Ajay Seth based on gait2354.osim Frank C. Anderson, and Scott L. Delp, Stanford University. Lower extremity joint defintions based on Delp et al. (1990). Low back joint and anthropometry based on Anderson and Pandy (1999, 2001). Planar knee model of Yamaguchi and Zajac (1989). Seth replaced tibia translation constraints with a CustomJoint for the knee and removed the patella to eliminate all kinematic constraints; insertions of the quadrucepts are handled with moving points in the tibia frame as defined by Delp 1990. Number of muscles were reduced by Reinbolt and Anderson to improve simulation speed for demonstrations and is not intended to be used in research.
